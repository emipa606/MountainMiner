- Removed the interaction-cell since it was not used anyway
- Added relative speed of mining based on the amount of overhead mountain around the drill, thanks HR-SP
- The chunk extracted will now match the stone-type of the roof, thanks HR-SP
- Added setting for how often chunks will spawn

This mod adds a Mountain Miner.
The mountain miner is a hand-operated machine used to mine out the area above the tunneling level. 
Allows for rock roof removal and produces chunks in the process.
